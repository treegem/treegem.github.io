I've always wanted to create a game. Never felt like actually learning to do so.
It is actual work: 
- chosing the correct engine
- learn the engine
- actively grow your diffuse idea to something that feels like a game
- do the coding

This has changed now and I don't know why. This is my go at it and I also chose to document all of this, especially in 
the hope that this will help with the long time motivation. A humongous fan base will keep me active : )

This is the current plan:
- It will be a 2d game
- It should be based upon [Pogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_caps_(game)), a 90s children's game.
- The genre will be a mixture between trading (card) game and classical level up RPG.
- The engine is [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- The whole progress is going to be blogged here.
