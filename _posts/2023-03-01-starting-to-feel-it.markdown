I've always wanted to create a game. However, I never felt like actually learning to do so. It is actual work, and involves the following steps:

- Choosing the correct engine
- Learning the engine
- Actively growing your diffuse idea to something that feels like a game
- Doing the coding

However, my perspective has changed now and I don't know why. This is my attempt at creating a game, and I've chosen to document all of this in the hope that it will help with long-term motivation. Perhaps a humongous fan base will keep me active : )

Here is my current plan:

- It will be a 2D game
- It should be based on [Pogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_caps_(game)), a 90s children's game.
- The genre will be a mixture between a trading (card) game and a classic level up RPG.
- The engine I've chosen is [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- The entire progress of this project will be blogged here.
