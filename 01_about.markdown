I have no clue how to create a game. No idea about game design, any gaming engine, pixel art... anything at all. I think you get it. But I really want to. So I will. And this blog is going to track the progress, be my diary and entertain at least myself in the future. In the best case, it might become instructional for another aspiring game dev.
